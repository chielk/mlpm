\section*{The Max-sum algorithm}
\begin{align*}
	\displaystyle
	\vec{x}^* &= \arg\max_{\vec{x}} \prod_\alpha f_\alpha (\vec{x}_\alpha)\\
	p(\vec{x}^*) &= \max_{\vec{x}} \frac{1}{Z} \prod_\alpha f_\alpha (\vec{x}_\alpha)\\
	\log p(\vec{x}^*) &= \log\left[\max_{\vec{x}} \frac{1}{Z} \prod_\alpha
			f_\alpha (\vec{x}_\alpha)\right]\\
	&= \max_{\vec{x}} -\log Z + \sum_\alpha \log f_\alpha (\vec{x}_\alpha)&
			\text{Determines the message $\mu$}\\
\end{align*}


max-beliefs/max-marginals
\begin{align*}
	\displaystyle
	q(\vec{x}_i) &= \max_{\vec{x}_i}
	\log p(\vec{x}_{\smallsetminus i}, \vec{x}_i)\\
				&= -\log Z +
	\sum_{\alpha \in \mathit{Nb}(i)} \mu_{\alpha \rightarrow i}(\vec{x}_i)
	& \text{$\mathit{Nb}(i)$ denotes the neighbours of $\vec{x}_i$}
\end{align*}

Given max-marginals you have to perform a decoding step (the Viterbi algorithm)
in order to find the global optimum. If $q(\vec{x}_i)$ is unique, we can use
$\vec{x}^*_i = \arg\max_{\vec{x}_i} q(\vec{x}_i)$
